    "# Reading from and writing to files\n",
    "Writing and reading to files - called input/output (io in short) - is an essential feature of many programing languages. In Python, io operations require three broad steps: \n",
    "1. Opening the file\n",
    "2. Reading or writing to the file (or both)\n",
    "3. Closing the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening the file is done via the `open` function, which is a built-in function. The function takes two arguments: the path of the file we would like to open (either relative to the Python script or absolute, e.g. C:/users/...), and a mode. There are several modes: \n",
    "1. `r` (reading) is the mode used to read a file\n",
    "2. `w` (writing) is the mode used to writing to a file. If the file already exists, **it is overwritten**\n",
    "3. `a` (appending) is used to append to a file. If the file doesn't exist, it is created. "
