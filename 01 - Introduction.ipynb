    "## 2. About the Python ecosystem\n",
    "Python can mean many things - the whole of which I define as the `Python ecosystem`. The Python ecosystem is made up of: \n",
    "1. **scripts**: files, created by end users, with written instructions, which are subsequently executed, \n",
    "2. **a grammar**: a set of syntax rules by which the scripts must abide, \n",
    "3. **an interpreter**: a program that reads, interprets and executes the scripts, \n",
    "4. **a (standard) library**: a set of pre-written scripts which we can re-use as end users, \n",
    "5. **packages**: a near-infinite set of other pre-written scripts, written by other users\n",
    "6. **editors**: software used to write scripts in; these include basic (e.g. Notepad++), interactive (Jupyter notebooks and Spyder) or integrated development environments (IDEs, such as PyCharm or VSCode)\n",
    "7. **an organisation**: the Python Software Foundation (PSF), in charge of maintaining and maturing the ecosystem"
